## About GB BASIC

**GameBuilder BASIC** (**GB BASIC**) is a retro Fantasy Console that generates ROMs compatible with the popular handheld game console. It has everything ready-to-use for writting code, making assets, compiling projects, running with the built-in emulator, exporting to runnable ROM, etc.

### Why GB BASIC?

GB BASIC is programmable in a brand new BASIC dialect. The integrated assets editors are intuitive to use. You can generate real ROMs and play on any GB emulator or hardware.

### Programming Paradigms

- Imperative paradigm
  - Non-structured programming
  - Concurrent processing approach
- Declarative paradigm
  - Data driven approach

### Features

- Programmable in BASIC, an easy to learn and fun to use programming language
- Easy to use API for graphics, input, audio, and other facilities
- Built-in libraries for scene, actor, controllers, GUI
- Built-in libraries for collision detection, persistence, RTC, etc.
- **Extension** feature including mouse & touch, shell command, debugging, etc.
- Handy tools for editing tiles, map, scene, actor, font, sound, etc.
- Project can be exported into real ROM
- Dozens of example projects

### Specs

## Installation

### Installing from Prebuilt

- [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2308700/)

### Compiling from Source

A C++14 capable compiler is required, any compiler came after 2014 should be ok. You need to get this repository and its submodules before build:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/paladin-t/gbb.git
cd gbb
```

#### Windows

Dependencies: Visual Studio (with C++ development tools installed).

#### MacOS

Dependencies: Xcode.

<details>
<summary>Steps</summary>

1. Build SDL2
	1. Compile dylib from "lib/sdl/Xcode/SDL/SDL.xcodeproj"
	2. Reveal "libSDL2.dylib" in Finder
	3. Copy "libSDL2.dylib" to "lib/sdl/lib/mac/"
2. Build GB BASIC
	1. Compile from "gbbasic.xcodeproj"
3. Build GBBVM
	1. Execute `gbbvm.sh`

</details>

#### Other platforms

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>

You can also setup your own build pipeline for other platforms. The "lib" and "src" directories are almost what you need.

The "platform_*" files contain most platform dependent code, you'll probably make a specific port.
